# Sparse-matrix-and-Polynomial
1.WAP to create a linked list that represents a polynomial expression with single variable 
(i.e. 5x 7 -3x 5 +x 2 +9) and display the polynomial by using user defined functions for 
creation and display. 
2. WAP by modifying the LA1 program to add two polynomials with single variable. Use 
the same function in LA1 written for creation &amp; display operations and write a new 
function for addition operations. 
3. A matrix m × n that has relatively few non-zero entries is called sparse matrix. It may be 
represented in much less than m × n space. An m × n matrix with k non-zero entries is 
sparse if k &lt;&lt; m × n. It may be faster to represent the matrix compactly as a list of the 
non-zero indexes and associated entries. WAP to represent a sparse matrix using linked 
list.
